# Base 2
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthewhartman/base.svg?branch=v2.0.1)](https://travis-ci.org/matthewhartman/base)

A super simple, responsive framework built for all devices big, small and in-between

### Responsive Design
Created to work on all devices big and small, Base has got you covered for your next exciting web project.

### Awesome Foundation
Built on Normalize.css, it includes all the foundation styles for typography, headings, lists, tables, code blocks, blockquotes, forms and more.

### Cross-Browser
Perfected to work with older browsers (IE8+) and modern browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Opera.

### Base is Awesome!

### Looking for the old Base?
Base 1 is still avilable for [download](https://github.com/matthewhartman/base/archive/v1.zip) and [documentation](http://matthewhartman.github.io/base/docs/v1-docs/) is avilable. 

Base was built by Matthew Hartman [(@hartmanmatthew)](http://twitter.com/matthewhartmans), a passionate front end developer based in Melbourne, Australia.
