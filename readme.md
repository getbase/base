## Overview

Base itself is a very thin layer which includes Normalize.css and a few mixins to get you started.

You can then include what you need on top of Base such as typography, grids, individual components, etc and make it yours.

* * *

## Installation

If you are creating a new project from scratch, it is highly recommended that you [use base starter](https://github.com/getbase/starter).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbase/starter.git \
new-website && cd new-website && rm -rf .git
npm install && npm start
```

For existing projects, simply install base using NPM.

```bash
npm install --save @getbase/base
```

Once you have Base installed, you can build on top of it by including your own custom styles or add the [ready made modules](#modules-and-components)
